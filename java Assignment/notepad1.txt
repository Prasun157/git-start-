Data science is an interdisciplinary academic field that uses statistics, 
scientific computing, scientific methods, processing, scientific visualization, 
algorithms and systems to extract or extrapolate knowledge from potentially noisy, 
structured, or unstructured data.

Data science also integrates domain knowledge from the underlying application 
domain (e.g., natural sciences, information technology, and medicine).
Data science is multifaceted and can be described as a science, a research
paradigm, a research method, a discipline, a workflow, and a profession.
